# How do you design web animations that are both fast and beautiful?
1 Choose the right animation method

There are different ways to create web animations, such as CSS transitions, CSS animations, JavaScript, SVG, and canvas. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type, complexity, and purpose of the animation. For example, CSS transitions and animations are easy to use, but have limited control and compatibility. JavaScript can offer more flexibility and interactivity, but can be more demanding on performance and browser support. SVG and canvas can create complex and scalable graphics, but can be harder to manipulate and optimize. You should choose the animation method that suits your needs and goals, and test it across different devices and browsers.

2 Optimize your animation performance

Web animations can drastically impact the performance of your website if they are heavy, frequent, or not coded correctly. To avoid lagging, jank, or crashing, you should optimize your animation performance by utilizing the transform and opacity properties as much as possible. These properties are handled by the GPU and do not trigger layout or paint operations. Additionally, it's important to avoid animating properties that cause layout or paint, such as width, height, margin, or background-color. You should also use requestAnimationFrame instead of setInterval or setTimeout to synchronize the animation with the browser's refresh rate and reduce unnecessary calculations. Furthermore, the will-change property should be used to inform the browser that an element will change in the future so it can prepare and optimize the rendering. Lastly, tools like Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, or WebPageTest can be used to measure and analyze your animation performance and identify potential issues.

3 Design for accessibility and usability

Web animations can have a major impact on the accessibility and usability of your website, especially for users with disabilities, low-bandwidth connections, or slow devices. To ensure that your web animations are accessible and usable, you should provide options to pause, stop, or hide the animation, or reduce its motion or speed. Additionally, use animation sparingly and purposefully and avoid excessive motion that can overwhelm users. Animation should complement the content and functionality of your website, guiding the user's attention and focus without distracting them from their interaction or navigation. Additionally, use contrast, color, and timing to create clear and consistent animation cues that won't cause seizures or visual impairments.

4 Follow the principles of animation

Web animations are not just about technical aspects, but also about artistic and aesthetic aspects. To create web animations that are both fast and beautiful, you should follow the principles of animation, which were developed by Disney animators to create realistic and appealing motion. These include squash and stretch to emphasize movement and elasticity, anticipation to create expectation and attention, ease in and out to accelerate or decelerate speed, follow through and overlapping action for realism and fluidity, secondary action to enhance the main action and character, as well as timing to create the desired effect and mood.

5 Experiment and learn from others

Web animations are a creative and dynamic field that requires constant experimentation and learning. If you want to design web animations that are both fast and beautiful, you should not be afraid to try new things, test different solutions, and learn from your mistakes. Additionally, itâ€™s a great idea to seek inspiration and feedback from other web designers and animators. You can find many examples and resources online, such as CodePen, Awwwards, CSS-Tricks, and the book Animation at Work by Rachel Nabors. With these tips and best practices in mind, web animations can be an effective way to make your website stand out and delight your users.
